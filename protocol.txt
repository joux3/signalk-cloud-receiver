Boat -> singalk-cloud-receiver
---

The first message from a client should contain the boat id as defined in config.
Each message after that should contain a running id generated by the client and
message. The server should ACK, ERRACK or INVALID every message. The client is
allowed to send multiple messages without waiting for ACKs inbetween.

Example message from the client:
{"msgId": 1, "path": "navigation.speedOverGround", "value": 4.12 }

Example ACK from the server:
{"ACK": 1}     // the number should be the msgId that client sent

{"ERRACK": 1}  // something failed in saving the message by the server, client
               // should retry sending it later

{"INVALID": 1} // the message from client was invalid and shouldn't be sent
               // again
